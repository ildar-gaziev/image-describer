# The describer of images

The extension using [Summarizer API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/summarizer-api), [Translator API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/translator-api), and [Promt API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/prompt-api)

## Overview

The Describer of Images is a Chrome extension that helps users understand, translate, and practice describing images. With a simple right-click on any picture on the web, the extension generates a preview card containing a concise, AI-powered description of the image.

Each generated card can be saved for later use, and users can translate the description into different languages for learning and accessibility purposes.

The extension also includes a built-in practice mode: users can listen to the description, try speaking it aloud, receive AI feedback on pronunciation and accuracy, and improve step-by-step through repetition.

This tool is designed for language learners, educators, accessibility enthusiasts, and anyone who wants to strengthen their ability to describe images clearly and naturally.
